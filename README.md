# iterategrations

Small integrations for [iterate](https://github.com/iterate/iterate) projects, one folder each. A
folder's `README.md` is the recipe: read it, then follow it. Each folder is also a package, built by
CI and served by [pkg.pr.new](https://pkg.pr.new) (never npm): a project's config repo depends on
`https://pkg.pr.new/jonastemplestein/iterategrations/<package>@<commit>`.

| Folder                              | Package                                    | What it does                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`pebble/`](pebble)                 | `iterate-pebble`                           | Receive Pebble Index 01 ring recordings (transcript event + audio file).                                                                              |
| [`waitrose/`](waitrose)             | `iterate-waitrose`                         | The Waitrose grocery API as a Cap'n Web RPC target, and its login as a secret's exchange code.                                                        |
| [`monzo/`](monzo)                   | `iterate-monzo`                            | Monzo transactions as events (a webhook with a generated secret in its URL), signed in through zero-trust-mcp.                                        |
| [`yoto/`](yoto)                     | none                                       | Yoto players and library for a project's agents, connected through zero-trust-mcp.                                                                    |
| [`whatsapp/`](whatsapp)             | none: run with `iterate provide`           | Your WhatsApp (Baileys, from your own computer) as `itx.whatsapp`, every message an event; a dummy to try it without an account.                      |
| [`whatsapp-calls/`](whatsapp-calls) | none: run with `iterate provide`           | WhatsApp voice calls both ways, carried to the project's voice app: `itx.whatsappCalls.call(…)` rings a person, and a known caller is picked up.      |
| [`herdr/`](herdr)                   | none: a Herdr plugin, or `iterate provide` | Your Herdr as `itx.jonas.herdr`: one `call(method, params)` for Herdr's whole socket API, and its events on a stream (news durable, focus ephemeral). |
| [`jmap/`](jmap)                     | `iterate-jmap`                             | A mailbox over JMAP (Fastmail by default): send from it (filed in Sent), search, threads; and Fastmail Masked Email, throwaway addresses on demand.   |
| [`telegram/`](telegram)             | `iterate-telegram`                         | A Telegram bot with its own Connect Telegram page: private chats and groups, each handed to an agent; invite links to let people in.                  |

[`zero-trust-mcp.md`](zero-trust-mcp.md) is the shared step behind Monzo and Yoto: connecting a
[zero-trust-mcp](https://github.com/iterate/zero-trust-mcp) server, which keeps no credentials of its
own, to a project. A folder without a package is just a recipe.

## Working on this repo

pnpm and [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev) (oxfmt, oxlint with type checking, Vitest, tsdown):

```sh
pnpm install   # also builds every package (the tests and the type check read dist) and installs the pre-commit hook
pnpm check     # vp check: format, lint, type-check
pnpm test      # each package's tests, against a fresh build
```

A commit runs `vp check --fix` on its staged files. A package's build is its `vite.config.ts`
(`vp pack`); the rest of the toolchain is the root `vite.config.ts`.
