// whatsapp.ts — your WhatsApp, lent to an iterate project from your own computer:
//
//   iterate provide whatsapp/src/whatsapp.ts --project <slug>
//
// Baileys (https://baileys.wiki) links this computer to your WhatsApp as a linked device, the way
// WhatsApp Web does, from your own IP. The lend is as thin as it can be, so Baileys' own
// documentation is the lend's:
//   - CALLS: every function of Baileys' socket, under its own name, as `itx.whatsapp.<name>(…)`:
//     `sendMessage(jid, content, options)`, `groupMetadata(jid)`, `updateProfilePicture(jid, { url })`
//     and the rest. Three are added for what is not a socket function: `downloadMedia(message)`,
//     `user()` (the linked account, Baileys' `sock.user`), and `getPNForLID(lid)` / `getLIDForPN(pn)`
//     (Baileys' `sock.signalRepository.lidMapping`).
//   - EVENTS: every event the socket emits lands on the project as `whatsapp/<Baileys' event name>`
//     (`whatsapp/messages.upsert`, `whatsapp/messages.update`, `whatsapp/group-participants.update`,
//     `whatsapp/presence.update`, `whatsapp/call`, …) with `payload.data` Baileys' own data. A
//     `messages.upsert` of several messages lands as one event a message (`data.messages` holds
//     the one), so a message has an event, and an offset, of its own. Only what must stay on this
//     computer is held back (`eventPayloads`): credentials, the QR code that links a device, and
//     the bulk of a history sync.
//   - TWO COPIES: every event lands on the account's stream, `/integrations/whatsapp`, the whole
//     account in order; and what belongs to one chat lands again on that chat's own stream,
//     `/integrations/whatsapp/chats/<jid>` (`chatParts`), the conversation alone.
